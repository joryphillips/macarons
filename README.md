# Macarons

Macarons is a design system with styled UI components intended for React projects. It was built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

# Usage

For now, clone the Macarons repo or copy and paste files from the components, styles, and themes folder. Macarons uses a static version of Remix, but Remix is not required to use the design system and components in Macarons. Check out the Vanilla Extract docs if you want to try using Macarons in a different framework or library.

# TODOs

- We'll work to get the components easily decoupled from the Remix app in the near future!
- Better formated code examples
- More comprehensive API documentation (or at least links to Radix)

# Contributions

Issues and PRs are very welcome.
